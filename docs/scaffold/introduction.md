# Getting Started

!!! Info
    Scaffold is a full-stack Laravel application, it assumes you have working knowledge of Laravel, Vue etc.

Grafite Scaffold is a very opinionated boilerplate for Laravel applications. In the past we made kits which built parts of apps with our Builder package. However, we find it significantly faster to just jumpstart with this application boilerplate.

!!! Info "Scaffold also uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com) patterns"

## Installation

Start a new project:

```bash
composer create-project grafite/scaffold {project_name}
```

There, you're done, now build something incredible.
