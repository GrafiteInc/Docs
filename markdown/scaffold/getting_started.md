# Getting Started

Grafite Scaffold is a very opinionated boilerplate for Laravel applications. In the past we made kits which built parts of apps with our Builder package. However, we find it significantly faster to just jumpstart with this as a starter repository.

!!! Info
    Scaffold is not a package, it is a boilerplate starter project, similar to `laravel/laravel` with a bunch more code written to speed up the process.

!!! Info "Scaffold also uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com) patterns"

## Installation

Start a new project:

```
composer create-project grafite/scaffold {project_name}
```

There, you're done.
