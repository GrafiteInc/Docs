# Upgrade Guide

Regarding upgrades
-----

Grafite Scaffold is boilerplate if we make updates and upgrades they may not be relevant to your application. Grafite Scaffold is not a dependency so you don't have to worry about that.

## Compatibility

In general our team will do their best to keep the Scaffold repository up to date with changes or adjustments in Laravel.
